Commentary
==========

Easily convert elisp file headers to markdown text. The file
comment headers should be similar to this one.

Installation
============

None

Use
===

Invoke this elisp file with emacs --script like so:
    `$ emacs --script make-readme-markdown.el < elisp-file-to-parse.el`

(Note: you might have to redirect stderr to `/dev/null` to avoid
some pesky "loading vc-git" messages and the like...)

Output is written to stdout.

You can also pass the -nospam switch to prevent the little
"Generated by" text from showing up.

Supported syntax
================

In order for this module to do you any good, you should write your
file header comments in a way that make-readme-markdown.el
understands. An attempt has been made to support the most common
file header comment style, so hopefully you shouldn't have to do
anything...

* ';;;' at the beginning of a line for a header.
* ';;`' at the beginning of a line for a code line.
* 'o' at the beginning of a line for a list item

Everything between `;;; Commentary:' and `;;; Code' will be
parsed. See make-readme-markdown.el for an example (you might
already be looking at it... whoa, this is really getting meta...).

If there's some more syntax you would like to see supported, submit
